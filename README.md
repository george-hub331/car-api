# car-api
I used PHP and mySQL for this project and chrome web browser

# how to use

- Run a web server that supports php and mysql.
conf.php contains the configuration for the web host, your server name, username, password, database(which is wootlab) as credentials for server connection

- import the sql file wootlab.sql into mysql.
It contains the database also

the main files are - 

- addcar.html
      to add a car to the database

- addlocation.php
      to add location to a car

- viewlast.php
      to view x last locations of a particular car model

- ability to add multiple cars at a time to reduce latency


# dependencies
